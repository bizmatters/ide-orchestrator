# Three types of dependencies based on CI stages
dependencies:
  # Platform services (checked in platform readiness)
  # Foundation services (external-secrets, crossplane-operator, cnpg, foundation-config) are always deployed
  # Only declare optional services that your service actually uses
  platform: []              # No optional platform services needed (uses foundation only)
  
  # External services (deployed before this service)
  external:
    - deepagents-runtime     # Must be deployed before ide-orchestrator
  
  # Internal services (validated after deployment)
  internal:
    - postgres               # Validates ide-orchestrator-db cluster
